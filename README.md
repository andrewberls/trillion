# Trillion - another responsive CSS framework.

When you're building a sweet HTML5 social cloud-based paradigm-shifting web app, you're going to want a front-end framework to prototype faster. As it turns out, there are roughly a trillion frameworks to choose from. This is my take on that.

Eventually, Trillion will provide a starting point for your pages, consisting of a browser reset, responsive grid (courtesy of [Cheeky.css](http://andrewberls.github.com/Cheeky/)), and some basic element styling to get you off the ground quickly. Right now, it's an alpha preview, meaning it probably looks like crap and has no features. I like to think of it as living on the edge. Caveat emptor!
